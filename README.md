## Welcome to Ling-de-long, a fresh from the box repoStory...

This is the story of daisy-doo and miley-moo (although sometimes we call her miley-poo, but that's a story for another day...
Anyhoo, here they are

I'd like to tell you a bit about both daisy and miley... daisy first 'cos she's been with me the longest and she's the older (and wisest) of the two pooches.

Daisy-doo

Daisy gets her nick-name from the song "Daisy Daisy give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you"

For some reason her nick-name got shortened to doo-doos and then (bizarrely) warped into boo-boos (I can't believe I'm telling you this!) and finally - just

doodes
