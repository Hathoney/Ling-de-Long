## Welcome to Ling-de-long, a fresh from the box repoStory...

This is the story of daisy-doo and miley-moo (although sometimes we call her miley-poo, but that's a story for another day...

I'd like to tell you a bit about daisy and miley but daisy first 'cos she's been with me the longest and she's the older (and wisest) of the two pooches.

Daisy-doo

Daisy gets her nick-name from the song "Daisy Daisy give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you"

I'd love to be writing more about the girls but right now I'm havin' trouble building with pages.....they say it's easy but I'm not so sure...
